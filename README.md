Food waste is a pressing global issue that not only contributes to environmental degradation but also exacerbates challenges related to food security. Grocery stores often discard items nearing their expiry dates, leading to significant waste. Simultaneously, many communities face food insecurity, struggling to access affordable and nutritious meals. Our solution addresses this dual challenge by creating a system that notifies grocery stores about expiring items. These stores can then alert food sharing communities, such as food banks and organizations like the Salvation Army, enabling them to purchase these items at lower prices. This approach not only reduces food waste and disposal costs for grocery stores but also empowers food sharing communities with increased purchasing power, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable food ecosystem
